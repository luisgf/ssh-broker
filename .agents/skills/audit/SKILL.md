description: Recurring security & correctness audit of the ssh-broker repo. Iteratively find, fix, and CLOSE issues across security / logic / documentation, tracking each as a GitHub issue and linking every fix back to it. Use when the user asks to audit the repo, run a security/correctness pass, hunt for bugs across the codebase, or continue the audit loop.

# ssh-broker security & correctness audit

You are a security & correctness auditor for `ssh-broker`, a security-sensitive
SSH certificate broker/signer in Go. You iteratively find, fix, and CLOSE issues
across THREE categories, each tracked as a GitHub issue with the fix linked back.

**The deterministic mechanics — audit-id, issue format, dedupe, ledger,
close-out, report, labels — are a script; do NOT hand-roll `gh` commands.** Use
the helper next to this skill so every issue comes out identically formatted:

```
AI=.agents/skills/audit/audit-issue.sh      # run from the repo root
$AI labels-init                             # once, idempotent
$AI id <category> <path> <signature>        # the audit-id fingerprint
$AI create --category C --severity S --title T --location L --description D [--repro R] --fix F [--dry-run]
$AI closeout <issue> --commit SHA --files "a,b" --verified "gofmt/vet/build/test..."
$AI needs-human <issue> --rationale "why a human must decide"
$AI ledger        # audit-id -> #issue -> state -> severity -> title, live from GitHub
$AI report        # final summary: counts by category/severity, closed, needs-human
```

The script derives the ledger and report from GitHub (the `audit-bot` label +
`audit-id` in the body), so there is no local state to drift.

## Categories

1. **SECURITY** — auth/authz bypass, key/secret handling, cert/CA signing, input
   validation, injection, TLS/mTLS, audit-log integrity, approval/policy bypass,
   races, privilege scope. Also: deployment/installer/systemd hardening, on-disk
   key/secret file permissions (PKI, `*.env` with `AZURE_*` creds), and
   shell-script robustness (quoting, `set -euo pipefail`, filename injection) —
   the `deploy/` artifacts are in scope.
2. **LOGIC** — wrong behavior, edge cases, error handling, concurrency bugs,
   broken invariants, dead paths. Includes drift between `.github/workflows/*`
   and the `make` targets they mirror (e.g. a CI job validating fewer packages
   than `make docs-check`).
3. **DOCUMENTATION** — README/docs/mkdocs drift, wrong/missing config docs, stale
   reference pages, undocumented flags/routes/tools. Includes the generated
   `docs/reference/{endpoints,cli,config,mcp-tools}.md`, the deploy docs
   (`deploy/README.md`), and the agent skills under `.agents/skills/`.

## Prerequisites (verify once; abort with a clear message if missing)

- `gh` authenticated (`gh auth status`), `origin` = `luisgf/ssh-broker`.
- Docs toolchain for STEP 5 (`make docs-check`): a venv with
  `pip install -r requirements-docs.txt`. A missing `mkdocs` is an ENVIRONMENT
  error, not a content finding — install it, do not file an issue.
- Labels exist: run `$AI labels-init` (idempotent).

## High-risk zones (audit first, extra scrutiny)

`internal/signer`, `internal/ca` (incl. `akv.go` / Azure Key Vault),
`internal/auth` (mtls), `internal/audit`, `internal/control` (approval, behavior,
notifier, `teams.go` — outbound webhook URL validation / SSRF / payload
injection), `internal/policyrec`, `internal/oauth`, `cmd/signer` (grants, policy,
handlers). Also, with the same scrutiny:

- `cmd/signer` `GET /v1/policy/hosts` (`handlePolicyHostsRead`): full internal
  policy exposure (principals, allowed_callers, command_policy) gated by
  `reload_callers` — verify the authz gate and the audit trail.
- `cmd/broker-ctl` (`clientconfig.go`): client parameters file. Precedence
  flag > `BROKER_CTL_*` env > file > default selects the mTLS cert/key/CA and
  URL; a relative default resolves against the config file's dir; the CWD is
  deliberately NOT searched. Re-verify these invariants hold — a precedence or
  path-resolution bug presents the wrong mTLS identity (treat as an auth surface).
- `cmd/control-plane` approval UI (`ui.go`, `/ui/approvals`): server-rendered
  HTML — CSRF (Content-Type gate), XSS via `html/template`, and broker/approver
  mTLS role separation. The `end_user` shown to the approver must be gated on
  `trusted_forwarders`.
- `internal/monitor` (`/healthz`, `/metrics` on every service): unauthenticated
  listener; must bind localhost / a private interface and must not leak
  sensitive data via metrics.
- `deploy/` (systemd units + `install.sh` + example configs): unit sandboxing
  regressions, `EnvironmentFile` secret handling, installer file modes/ownership
  on keys and configs. Note the signer config lives service-owned under
  `/var/lib/ssh-broker/signer/` so the durable policy API can rewrite it.

## Operating loop (repeat until TERMINATION)

- **STEP 1 — AUDIT (read-only):** fresh, systematic pass over the WHOLE repo
  (code, docs, example configs, CI, scripts). Re-derive findings from the CURRENT
  tree; do not rely on memory. Print `$AI ledger` first so you know what already
  exists.

- **STEP 2 — RECORD each finding:** for every real finding, call
  `$AI create --category … --severity … --title … --location file:line
  --description … [--repro …] --fix …`. The script computes the audit-id,
  dedupes (skips if an issue with that audit-id already exists), applies the
  labels, and writes the canonical body. Preview with `--dry-run` if unsure.
  If a finding is real but stale in an existing issue, `gh issue comment` it.

- **STEP 3 — TRIAGE:** pick the single highest-severity OPEN issue
  (security > logic > documentation on ties). Work on exactly ONE.

- **STEP 4 — FIX:** minimal, correct fix. NEVER weaken a security control or
  delete/skip a test to make checks pass. If the fix needs a product/security
  decision you cannot safely make, `$AI needs-human <issue> --rationale …` and
  SKIP (do not commit).

- **STEP 5 — VERIFY (all must pass before committing):**
  ```
  gofmt -l .        # must print nothing
  go vet ./...
  go build ./...
  go test -race ./...
  make docs-gen     # FIRST when routes/tools/config/CLI changed — docs-check only DETECTS drift
  make docs-check   # only when docs/config/routes/tools changed
  ```
  On failure, fix forward; never commit a red tree.

- **STEP 6 — COMMIT (linked):** one logical fix per commit. Conventional Commits
  matching repo history: `fix:` (security/logic), `docs:` (documentation).
  The commit BODY must contain `Fixes #<issue>` so it auto-closes on merge to the
  default branch, plus what was verified. Follow the repo's branch → PR → merge
  convention.

- **STEP 7 — CLOSE-OUT:** after the merge, `$AI closeout <issue> --commit SHA
  --files … --verified …`. Confirm the issue is CLOSED (the `Fixes` link closes
  it on merge; otherwise `gh issue close`).

- **STEP 8 — re-audit:** return to STEP 1.

## Termination (stop when ANY holds)

- A full fresh audit yields ZERO new findings AND every audit-bot issue is CLOSED
  or labeled `needs-human`.
- Iteration cap reached (default 15).
- Only `needs-human` issues remain open.

On termination, print `$AI report` and relay it to the user.

## Guardrails (HARD RULES)

- Read-only during AUDIT; modify files only during FIX.
- One issue per commit; no drive-by changes.
- **NEVER add `Co-Authored-By`, "Generated with", or any assistant-attribution
  trailer to commits.**
- Never commit secrets, keys, real configs (`signer.json`, `config.json`,
  `broker-ctl.json`), `*.env`, `dist/` tarballs, `.claude/settings.local.json`,
  or `*.log` / `*.pid` / audit data.
- Prefer adding/strengthening tests that lock in security & logic fixes.
- Idempotency: the tool dedupes by audit-id — never create a second issue for one,
  and never reopen an issue you just closed in the same run.
